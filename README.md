# Multiplayer Oneline Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a multiplayer online version of tic-tac-toe that I built during my first week of the #100daysofcode challenge. The rules are the same as regular tic-tac-toe. 

## Live Version
You can play it live at https://tictactoe.ryancarr.ca

## Features
After you enter your name upon loading the website for the first time, you can either create a game or join an existing game if there is one. Once 2 people are in the game, the game will start. 

There is a realtime chat to give kind compliments to your opponents and to get updates about the status of the game. I also added a dark mode feature, only because I personally think every website should have their own darkmode. 

## Credit where it is due
This code is based off of 3 tutorials from a youtube channel called WebDevSimplified. All the techniques in these videos were combined together to build this multiuplayer version of tic-tac-toe. Credit goes to Kyle (channel owner) for his tutorials. I am simply a student who is trying to learn everything I can the best way I can.
